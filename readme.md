## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- kaggle.json
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Operating system

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
- git clone <repository_url>

2. Install the required dependencies:
-pip install kaggle, kaggle-datasets ,matplotlib ,pandas ,tansorflow

3. Run the script: Customer Subscription Prediciton 

4. Training Process
- The script loads the dataset and performs data preprocessing.
- A convolutional neural network model based on InceptionV3 is defined.
- The model is trained on the training set with validation performed on the validation set.
- Training progress, including accuracy and loss, is displayed.

5. Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated on the test set.
- Test accuracy and loss are reported.

6. Saving the Model
- The trained model is saved to the "Customer Subscription Prediciton " directory.

## Files
- `Customer Subscription Prediciton `: The main Python script for training and evaluating the model.
- `README.md`: This file providing detailed information about the project.
- `CustomerSubscriptionPrediciton /`: Directory containing the saved model.
